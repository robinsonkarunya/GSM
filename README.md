# Industrial Automation using LPC2129 Microcontroller 
Industrial automation using the LPC2129 microcontroller, GSM 800C module, relay, and actuator enables remote control and monitoring of industrial systems. The LPC2129, with its ARM7 core, controls the overall system, managing inputs from sensors and sending commands to relays and actuators. The GSM 800C module allows for wireless communication, enabling remote access via SMS or calls for system status updates or to trigger actions. Relays are used to control high-power devices, while actuators perform physical tasks like opening valves or moving machinery. This setup is ideal for applications like automated irrigation, security systems, or remote machinery monitoring, offering flexibility, efficiency, and real-time control, even from distant locations.
